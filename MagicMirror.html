This idea started when I was browsing reddit a week or two before fathers day. Like most 19 year olds, I didn't know what I was going to get
my dad for fathers day yet. I stumbled across a post of someone who had just finished making a magic/smart mirror.
It seemed really cool, so I decided to do a little more reading about the project.
The list of items needed for this project was suprisngly small for what I was expecting.
It was only:
  <ul>
    <li>A Piece of Acrylic</li>
    <li>A Monitor</li>
    <li>A Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li>A USB Mouse and Keyboard</li>
    <li>A Wood Frame</li>
  </ul>
All of these things could be easily obtained through Amazon, and I was looking to do some type of EE/CS project over summer anyways so why not make the Magic Mirror my dad's present?

  Once I got all of the parts listed above shipped to my house, I started putting things together.
  First, I unboxed the raspberry pi, hooked it up to my monitor and downloaded the Raspian Operating System.
  Once the operating system was installed, I manuvered my way over to the open source software for the <a target="_blank" href="https://magicmirror.builders/">Magic Mirror</a> project.
