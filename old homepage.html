				<!-- This is going to be my bio-->
				<p style="color:red;">
					Bio: My name is Bryce John Moskiewicz. I was born and raised in La Grange, Illinois. I have a family of four which includes my mother Michele, my father Alan, and my brother Brent. I currently play on the varsity baseball team at the University of Pittsburgh and hope to become an Electrical Engineer after my four years at Pitt. The University of Pittsburgh was my first choice of school because it checked all of the boxes, and then some. I love the urban feel of the university since I was born and raised just outside the city of Chicago. The ability to go watch any of the local professional sports teams was crucial to my decision to attend the University of Pittsburgh. When I was in high school, I took Calculus one, two, and three, as well as linear algebra, so I will only need to take one single Math class during my time here at Pittsburgh. The University accepted 30 credits from my high school work, so I may be able to graduate in 3 and a half years if I schedule everything correctly. In high school I also played both Football and Baseball. My high school baseball team won conference both two times during my tenure on the team, and my high school football team came in second both years I played at the varsity level. I have loved math and science all of my life, which is part of the reason that I participated in a program that bussed middle school students to the local high school to take advanced mathematics courses. I was fortunate to grow up in the city where I did, and I took every opportunity that came to me. I am a hardworking and determined student who refuses to fail and strives to overachieve.

				<p>
					I really like to play baseball, as well as study mathematics and physics. Baseball has been a part of my life since I was born. I remember when the Chicago White sox won the World Series and how excited I was when it finally happend. I also love studying physics and math because it is the basis for the entire world we live in. Without math and physics, no human would be alive. I can not wait to finally reach my goals of becoming an electrical engineer in the near future.
